Given the right plugins and config, these alternate projections could happen to be more intuitive to grasp/edit than the original source code. One plugin could, for example, remove all the unnecessary semicolons. Another, could remove all the unnecessary punctuations and project the code in an indentation-significant way or vice-versa. Your idea to replace all the `'bar' + foo`s with ``bar{foo}``s would also be possible.\n\nIt's easy to imagine much more advanced use-cases. A sufficiently advanced editor could detect calls to FRP libraries, and project the data flow as a visual graph (picture all the `flatMaps()` and `scanLatest()s` as nodes on that graph). Or, given access to compile-time type info (via a typescript-style language-server), it could overlay the type of a value with the missing fields being shown as slots to be filled.\n\nI can imagine such an editor to mostly \"obsolete\" the idea of a single syntax for each language in the first place. Like the language but not the syntax? Roll your own syntax! Just configure your own editor plugins. No one would have to know. No one would have to agree with your \"taste.\" Not even your git repo [0]. (See /r/nosyntax/ for more ideas)\n\nA projectional editor can also be implemented in the runtime, ala Smalltalk. In that case, the language itself is designed from the bottom up to accommodate such DX and opens many more possibilities.\n\nA Clojure Conj talk called \"... forgotten Lisp UX\" explores the history of this idea in the context of lisp [1].

Some thoughts...\n\nGeneral UX: \"What will/did this button-with-no-tooltip do?\" was a theme for me.\n\nTour UX: I felt trapped in chains of modal windows.\n\nPerhaps add \"clicking outside modal windows bails out of chain\"; and in Overview, \"clicking on numbered topic jumps to that step\".  These are perhaps low hanging fruit for restoring some user control of navigation?\n\nI wonder if \"tours\" is the right objective.  Perhaps topical examples?  Eg \n\nhttps://threejs.org/examples/\n\n ?  However... many use youtube videos to learn code far more than I would, so perhaps I'm just not the target audience for a video-like tour.  Perhaps a label change to set expectations \"Take a video-like tour\"?  But I expect to be able to jump around in videos.  Screencast the tours for youtube?\n\nLanguage: I wish the type system was richer.  I'd happily accept \"projections have structured comments describing unrepresentable semantics\" for that.  If I could express the type \"thing with a partial order < and a +\", then I'd have looked to sign up, intending to upload a bunch of algorithm code.\n\nFunctions are nice, but to win big, we need a better type system than is currently available.  ADT's don't scale.  Witness haskell's half-decade of heroic effort... just to insert Applicative. Anyone wants to make something like this with a type system that's a pushout lattice of theories, I am your slave.  Figuratively.\n\nRandomness:  Projective editing might help with the Unicode!/Ascii! Agda/Idris rift, but the semantics would be a challenge, and the market small.  Though its maybe a good population to attract if the type system were more of a focus.  Fortress-style \"projected to look like math\" might appeal to Julia-is-the-new-FORTRAN folks?  Using kate.com-style emacs/vi/etc plugins with a \"sidebar\" website window for value-add, might separate out the \"switch to us as your editor\" aspect from the \"here's analysis and ecosystem\" aspect.\n\nXR changes the UX constraint space for this kind of thing.  Perhaps startlingly soon and rapidly.  So something to keep an eye on.  The bite-sized functions, sidebar analysis, refactoring, fine-grain ecosystem, and type directed development and search, seem good matches for an XR UI."}

Many credit Apple and IBM for this radical shift, but in 1973, years before the Apple II and IBM PC, Xerox built the Alto, a computer its makers thought could become the \u201ccomputer of tomorrow.\u201d The Alto embodied for the first time many of the defining features of personal computing that seem natural now, over forty years later: individual use; interactive, graphical displays; networking; graphical interfaces with overlapping windows and icons; WYSIWYG word processing; browsers; email; and the list goes on . The birthplace of this pioneering machine was Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), which assembled a remarkable collection of computer scientists and engineers who made real their idea of \u201cdistributed personal computing.\u201d\n\nOriginal members of the PARC team will present live demonstrations of, and discuss, some of the Alto\u2019s remarkable achievements: Tom Malloy and Charles Simonyi will present Bravo, the WYSIWYG word processor; Bob Sproull will show the graphics programs Markup and Draw; Doug Brotz will display the email client Laurel; Dan Ingalls will reveal the breakthrough programming environment and language Smalltalk; and John Shoch will survey the Alto\u2019s other accomplishments. Our program will close with an audience Q&A session with the PARC presenters. The event will be moderated by David C. Brock, Director of the Museum\u2019s Center for Software History. This will be a unique opportunity to learn about yesterday\u2019s computer of tomorrow that profoundly shaped our world.\n\nThis event is co-produced by the Museum\u2019s Center for Software History @CHM(, which collects preserves, interprets, and presents to the world the history of software and its ongoing impact on global society. The Center for Software History\u2019s Al Kossow restored two Xerox Alto computers starting in March of 2017 as part of the center\u2019s Alto System Project. An extensive Alto software archive has been preserved by Al Kossow and extensively curated by valued Museum volunteer Paul McJones, and it publicly available on the Museum\u2019s website. You can learn more about the revolutionary Alto in our permanent exhibition, \n\nRevolution: The First 2000 Years of Computing\n\n."}

The Android team has made the determination that that's an acceptable risk.  I won't argue -- perhaps I agree and perhaps I don't, but it is unambiguously less secure than the single, all-encompassing approach.  To claim so is hardly disingenuous.\n\nOf course, as with my house, this just changes the class of attack.  On either platforms you can consider attacking whatever authentication module \n\ntalks\n\n to the TEE.  Both systems use other mechanisms for that.\n\nFinally, in the Android case a vendor is free to do what they want, especially if they don't care about access to branding, google services etc.  Google branded devices have a more important brand to defend than, say, Asus (not to pick on Asus), much less, say, DJI's drones, for which the Android branding is utterly irrelevant (conceivably that could rebound on Google though personally I doubt it would even happen.

Practically no one understood the Begin{FunctionName}Async/End{FunctionName}Async pattern that the best of those wrappers used at the time and so many developers settled for synchronous blocking and deadlocking anti-patterns instead.\n\nWhich again leads to the more general problem with such things that: when they worked right they were magic, and when they didn't work they were (practically) impossible to debug.\n\nThere is something to be said that, too, that no one wanted to write a WSDL definition file or a SOAP wrapper by hand, so you were always fighting your tooling to produce what you needed and had a hard time correcting it when it did something sub-optimal.\n\nI don't think swagger is a terribly huge step backwards as in general what I've seen of swagger is lot more descriptive than prescriptive. I've seen some swagger-described APIs that are heavily hypermedia and take a strong REST approach, and I've seen some swagger-described APIs that might as well be SOAP for as much as they resemble \"proper\" REST and/or hypermedia. It certainly feels more pragmatic than SOAP/WSDL, in trying to describe a lot of the variety in how people build REST-ish APIs, and maybe in that way it's a step forwards from a once-sized-fits-all prescriptive approach. (In that way it too is a step backwards in that sometimes a good prescriptive approach might lead people more easily down a \"happy path\" of best practices, but that's always the hard balance: pragmatism versus theoretical purity. The pendulum swings.)"}

In the process of covering all the bases with precise req/res definitions and examples (yay, JSON Schema![6]), I uncovered a lot of corner cases in the API's functionality and made sure they were handled properly or at least documented well.\n\nI co-located the openapi.yaml file and ReDoc[7] with the API, and now it has beautiful web-based documentation. It also has JS, Python and curl code samples for all endpoints, generated with Paw and included in the YAML formatted description. ReDoc displays them nicely, with syntax highlighting.\n\nIn short, even though I worked \"backwards\" \u2014 matching the OpenAPI description to the functionality \u2014 it was a fruitful exercise and the results seem pretty good.

API Builder solves a number of those problems.\n\nA few reasons why teams adopt API Builder.\n\n- Very, very high quality generated clients: Teams that use API Builder end up relying 100% on the generated clients - ie. the developers STOP writing and managing their own client SDKs, freeing up time to focus on product improvements.\n\n- History: Every change in spec is documented - accurate and automatic - e.g. \n\nhttps://app.apibuilder.io/history?org=apicollective&app=apib...\n\n- Resource centric: API Builder is resource first - instead of defining an operation explicitly, you define resources and then expose operations on that resource.\n\n- Simple service specification: API Builder at its core separates the notion of the input format (e.g. api.json, swagger, avro) from the service description (service.json). This is a huge advantage: regardless of input format, the service specification can be fully expanded and complete.\n\n- Simple input format: The default api.json format is simple for humans to write. It is JSON, but more than that it is approachable by a novice and designed to be both simple and easy.\n\n- Easy to add code generators: Code generators in API Builder are themselves REST services which accept a service description (in JSON) and essentially return a string. Teams often write their own code generators - even small disposable ones - to systematically solve problems in an automated fashion.\n\n- Testability of clients: With generated mock clients built from the same interface definition, teams can rely on mocks when building automated tests - and further use the provided mock clients to override only the specific features needed for a given test.\n\n- Workflow that works with micro or mono repos and allows for concurrent, branched development of spec, service and client\n\nMore at \n\nhttps://www.apibuilder.io/\n\n and \n\nhttps://app.apibuilder.io/doc/why\n\n[edit: formatting]"}

Plenty of Swiss banks have been compelled to turn over US citizen information due to FATCA \u2014 it\u2019s not a stretch that a legitimate request for information by the US government would be honored by the Swiss if it pertains to a US citizen.

Also, you\u2019d need to ensure that all your recipients are also using non-US as well as non-British, or non-French systems as well.\n\nUS surveillance is in the spotlight, but France and the UK are equally aggressive, if not more so since the actual laws in the UK and France are much more liberal in terms of allowing government to intercept communications.

Finally, on a peak so remote and small it's scarcely visible from the ground, we have actual cryptography design flaws, where someone literally rolls their own crypto at the conceptual level and deploys it.\n\nSecond, email is a fundamentally antagonistic medium when it comes to end-to-end encryption. If you are actually concerned about your privacy and you're discussing something that warrants extreme care, email is the least user-friendly and most error-prone method of going about it. You should consider a synchronous medium with forward security if possible, probably based on a well-known and well-audited messaging protocol (to avoid a flame war I'm not going to suggest any particular one - do your research).\n\nThird, if your threat model is honestly the US government, you need to significantly revise your opsec entirely if you're realistically considering Protonmail. Regardless of its actual security, you're (implicitly) saying that you trust Protonmail to be capable of withstanding the resources of a motivated three letter agency with an armada of security compromising tools at its disposal. Why trust a third party at all then? What makes you think the servers being in Switzerland is going to help you if you distrust the government this much? By all means, don't use Gmail either, but then Protonmail isn't really a coherent security measure either - again, use a synchronous messaging platform, or develop the opsec needed to consistently use PGP correctly on your own.\n\nGiven the foregoing, if your adversary is actually the US government, neither Gmail or Protonmail are effective strategies, and if your adversary is not the US government, Google's security team is vastly more qualified and has overwhelmingly more resources at its disposal to secure its email infrastructure."}

There are other trust bundles with different logos and requirements.\n\nBut the direct project defines more than just the PKI. It defines edge protocols such as XDR and IMAP. It also defines methods for message delivery and processed notifications.\n\nAnd of course you can create your own trust bundle with whatever requirements you want.\n\nThis particular accredited portion means that these organizations have particular identity vetting processes for users, have on site visits to inspect servers, and adhere to a long list of privacy and security practices."}
